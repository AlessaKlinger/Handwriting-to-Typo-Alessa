## What is it about?

MyScriptJS is a JavaScript library that can be used in every web application (whatever JavaScript framework you are using) to bring handwriting recognition. 

It integrates all you need:  

* Signal capture,  
* Digital ink rendering,  
* Plug with MyScript Cloud to bring handwriting recognition.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

1. Have [bower](https://bower.io/#install-bower) installed.  
2. Have a MyScript developer account. You can create one [here](https://developer.myscript.com/).  
3. Get your keys and the free monthly quota to access MyScript Cloud at [developer.myscript.com](https://developer.myscript.com)

### Installation

1. Download MyScriptJS library 
```shell
bower install myscript
```

2. Create and edit `index.html` file in the same directory.

3. Add the following lines in the `head` section ot your file. We use pep to ensure better browsers compatibilities. Note that you can also use it using bower dependencies:  
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="bower_components/myscript/dist/myscript.min.css"/>
<script src="bower_components/myscript/dist/myscript.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/pep/0.4.3/pep.js"></script>
```

4. In the `body` tag, create a `div` tag that will contain the editing zone:
```html
    <div id="editor"></div>
```

5. In JavaScript, create the editor attached to editor DOM Node:
```javascript
  var editorElement = document.getElementById('editor');

  MyScript.register(editorElement, {
    recognitionParams: {
      type: 'MATH',
      server: {
        applicationKey: '#YOUR MYSCRIPT CDK APPLICATION KEY#',
        hmacKey: '#YOUR MYSCRIPT CDK HMAC KEY#'
      }
    }
  });
```
  
6. Launch a local webserver and browse the sample.
