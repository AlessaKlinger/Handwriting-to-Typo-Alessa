- New events to be notified of editor changes.
- New `penStyle` property. Used to change current pen style.

## Breaking changes
- Complete rewrite with ES6 syntax
- Internal design improved to allow extensibility and support of upcoming recognition types. See the [documentation](./docs/index.html) and [examples](./examples/index.html) to discover new behavior. 
- Removal of all deprecated attributes and methods

- All events has been renamed.
